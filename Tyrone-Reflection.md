Thinking Process

Going into this project, I had a specific idea of what to do in mind, and after researching other bug repellent sites I knew I wanted to go for a more corporate look to go more into the professional side of bug repellents, as it seemed there wasn't any other company doing that, and it seemed nice to have a more minimalistic take on the products, as if Google or Apple was doing it. ChatGPT was a huge help. Of course, I had to edit certain things it spat out, but this project likely would not be possible without it, or at least it would look wildly different. ChatGPT dealt with a lot of the CSS, while I mostly filled in the information, fixed up gaps in its illusions, and wove everything together through the navigation. The overall formatting of the site was also suggested by me, but written by ChatGPT. Overall, I am somewhat disappointed with myself on how useless I was at making my own design, as ChatGPT did most of the work. However, I learned a lot from this project, even just watching the AI work and fixing its errors gave me enough knowledge to hopefully make a functional website on my own.
